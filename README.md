4C ("Comprehensive Computational Community Code") is a parallel multiphysics research code
to address a plethora of physical problems by means of _computational mechanics_.

Large parts of 4C are based on finite element methods (FEM),
but alternative discretization methods, such as discontinuous Galerkin methods (DG),
particle methods and mesh-free methods have also been successfully integrated.
The research software is implemented throughout in object-oriented programming (C++)
using modern software design and is parallelized with MPI for distributed memory hardware architectures.

**Disclaimer**: 4C is developed for research purposes in the field of numerical method development.
It is not intended for any use beyond this purpose and generally should not be used for any form of
safety-relevant or safety-critical calculations
or for an application in association with physical products in particular.

## Getting started

To quickly run 4C, you can use our docker image, where 4C comes pre-compiled.
```
docker run --interactive --tty ghcr.io/4c-multiphysics/4c:main
/home/user/4C/build/4C ../tests/input_files/<some-input-file>.4C.yaml output_name
```

See our [documentation](https://4c-multiphysics.github.io/4C/readthedocs/installation.html) for more information on how to build 4C from source on your machine.
Consult our [Tutorials](https://4c-multiphysics.github.io/4C/readthedocs/tutorials.html) to get an overview of the general workflow in 4C.
