## Welcome to the 4C development team!

We're happy to have you on board and created this onboarding issue to get you started. Its main purpose is to guide you through your first steps and introduce you to other developers working on similar topics. Take your time to work through the checklist below and tell us a little bit about yourself by filling the following introduction section (click on the pencil symbol above to edit this description). Finally, please let us know if you have any ideas how to improve this onboarding procedure and the provided documentation.


## Brief introduction of the new team member
<!---
This is of course completely up to you. Feel free to share with us watever you like.
However, to give you some inspiration, here is a list of things that might be of interest for others:
Your name, affiliation, office location, background (field of study, prior experience with coding), field of research (fluid/solid/coupled problems) and favorite soccer club (just joking).

To be filled by the new team member.
