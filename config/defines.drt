# List of all possible defines 
#     NEW discretization
# ============================
#

# Uncomment all flags you want to include in your baci build. But please do
# not edit this file directly. Make a copy and edit the copy instead. See the
# baci beginners guide on how to setup baci.

# Always include the flag that turns on the new discretization!
CCADISCRET           # use new baci discretization subsystem DRT

# Even though we never make mistakes debugging is an option
# DEBUG

#   problem types
#  ===============
# D_TSI              # thermal structure interaction problem


#   additional features
#  =====================
# BINIO               # binary io
# QHULL               # needed for XFEM simulations
# D_EXODUS            # Pre_exodus (exodusII, netcdf)
# PARMETIS            # use parmetis for parallel setup of node graph
# D_ALE_BFLOW         # adds the effect of ALE defformation on the volumetric flow rate calculation on the boundaries
# EXTENDEDPARALLELOVERLAP # use overlap of 3 instead of overlap of one in parallel (needed for nstet elements))

#   tools
#  =======
# PERF               # detailed time measurement (overhead!!!)

#   fancy stuff
#  =============
# COLOROUTPUT        # use colored output to the terminal
# DSERROR_DUMP       # dserror creates a core file
# TRAP_FE            # crash ccarat if a nan of inf occurs
# THROWELEMENTERRORS # throw errors at element level so all element error can be found
