# List of all possible defines 
#     NEW discretization
# ============================
#

# Uncomment all flags you want to include in your baci build. But please do
# not edit this file directly. Make a copy and edit the copy instead. See the
# baci beginners guide on how to setup baci.

# Always include the flag that turns on the new discretization!
CCADISCRET           # use new baci discretization subsystem DRT

# Even though we never make mistakes debugging is an option
# DEBUG
