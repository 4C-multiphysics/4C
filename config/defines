# List of all possible defines 
#     OLD discretization
# ============================
#

# Uncomment all flags you want to include in your baci build. But please do
# not edit this file directly. Make a copy and edit the copy instead. See the
# baci beginners guide on how to setup baci.

# Note: If you are new to baci you might not want to use this file. Have a
# look at defines.drt for the much shorter list of flags that applies to the
# new discretization.

#   even though we never make mistakes debugging is an option
# DEBUG
