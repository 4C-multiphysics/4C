# Style configuration for Baci to be used with clang-format
#
# Baci's code style is based on the Google code style. However, we aggreed to deviate
# from it slightly to account enhance readibility and to address Baci specifics.

## Define the base style. We use Google's style here.
BasedOnStyle: Google                # Use Google style as baseline configuration and specify deviations explicitly as given below

## Define our deviations from the base style. Let's limit ourselves to very few exceptions.
AlignAfterOpenBracket: DontAlign    # Align function arguments after line break at custom indentation rather than at the opening (
BreakBeforeBraces: Allman           # Always move the opening { to the next line
ColumnLimit: 100                    # Break lines after 100 columns/characters
MaxEmptyLinesToKeep: 3              # Max. number of emtpy lines
NamespaceIndentation: All           # Add one level of indentation per namespace nesting
SortIncludes: false                 # Do not sort includes as ordering matters in Baci
SpacesInContainerLiterals: false    # Do not insert spaces after and before parenthesis, here []
Standard: c++17                     # Use the Cpp17 code style
TabWidth: 2                         # Make sure we use our desired tab width
