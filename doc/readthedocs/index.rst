|FOURC|
========

Mission statement
=================

|FOURC| is a parallel multiphysics research code
to analyze and solve a plethora of physical problems
described by ordinary or partial differential equations.
Its development is driven by challenging research questions and real-world problems,
for which existing tools do not suffice,
either due to the lack of capabilities or due to falling short of accuracy or performance.

|FOURC| not only provides ready-to-use simulation capabilities for a variety of physical models,
including single fields such as solids and structures, fluids, or scalar transport,
and multiphysics coupling and interactions between several fields,
but also a modular software environment for research in mathematical modeling and numerical methods.
Pre- and post-processing tools facilitate the use of |FOURC| within streamlined application workflows in science and engineering.
For spatial discretization, |FOURC| mostly relies on finite element methods (FEM, CutFEM).
It leverages the `Trilinos project <https://trilinos.github.io>`_ for sparse linear algebra, nonlinear solvers, and linear solvers and preconditioners
to be executed on MPI-parallel computing clusters.
Through its comprehensive set of physics modules available to all users without coding effort,
|FOURC| facilitates the advancement of research in all areas of science, engineering, and biomedicine.
