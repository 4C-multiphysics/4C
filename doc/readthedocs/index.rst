.. note::

    This is a draft of the |FOURC| documentation, and the content is rather incomplete.
    The faster additional content is added,
    the sooner the documentation will be useful for users to understand the various types of simulations and their application.
    Some documentation parts are highly relevant for many users; those need an update with highest priority.
    A list of items that should be added asap, is given :ref:`here<items-to-be-added>`.
