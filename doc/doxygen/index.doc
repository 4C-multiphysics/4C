\section Overview

4C (Comprehensive Computational Community Code) is a powerful research code for multi-physics computer simulations.
Building on more than 20 years of research and development, 4C can model a plethora of physical systems, including solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, scalar transport, and chemical reaction among others.

Large parts of 4C are based on finite element methods (FEM), but alternative discretization methods such as discontinuous Galerkin methods (DG), particle methods and mesh-free methods have also been successfully integrated. The research software is implemented throughout in object-oriented programming (C++) using modern software design and is parallelized with MPI for distributed memory hardware architectures.
