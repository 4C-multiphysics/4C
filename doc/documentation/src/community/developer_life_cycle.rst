.. _DeveloperLifeCycle:


Developer life cycle model
==========================

Becoming a member of the developer group
----------------------------------------

Contributors who actively engage with the project - whether by submitting meaningful pull requests, reviewing code, participating in discussions, or assisting with issues - may be invited to join the :ref:`developer_definition` group.

 .. note:: Remember, you do not have to be a member of the developer group to contribute!

Inactivity and removal
----------------------

Open-source projects evolve, and contributor activity may fluctuate. If a developer has not been actively contributing for a significant period of time (e.g., 12 months), they may be removed from the developer group. This ensures that active community members are overseeing the approval and merging process.

Rejoining the developer group
-----------------------------

Being removed from the developer group due to inactivity is not a permanent status. If a previous developer resumes regular contributions, they may be re-added to the group following the same criteria used for initial inclusion.

This cycle ensures that the project remains actively maintained while welcoming both new and returning contributors.
