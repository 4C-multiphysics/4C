A number of tools are available to work with |FOURC|.
If you also have a tool for |FOURC| or a project that works with |FOURC| please open a PR to add it to this list.

4C-Webviewer
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `4C-Webviewer <https://github.com/4C-multiphysics/4C-webviewer>`_ is designed to visualize and edit the input of 4C.
Instead of working with the text-based YAML input files directly, users can view and interact with the geometry of the problem they want to solve using 4C within their browser.


FourCIPP
~~~~~~~~

`FourCIPP <https://github.com/4C-multiphysics/fourcipp>`_ (FourC Input Python Parser) holds a Python Parser to simply interact with 4C YAML input files.
This tool provides a streamlined approach to data handling for third party tools.

cubitpy
~~~~~~~

`cubitpy <https://github.com/imcs-compsim/cubitpy>`_ provides utility functions and 4C related functionality for the Cubit and Coreform python interface,
especially for the creation of input files for 4C.

lnmmeshio
~~~~~~~~~

`lnmmeshio <https://github.com/amgebauer/lnmmeshio>`_ is a Python package to read and write discretizations of different formats including the 4C format.

beamme
~~~~~~

`beamme <https://beamme-py.github.io/beamme/>`_ is a general purpose 3D beam finite element input generator written in Python.
It contains advanced geometry creation and manipulation functions to create complex beam geometries, including a consistent handling of finite rotations.

pipapo
~~~~~~
`pipapo <https://github.com/particles-pipapo/pipapo>`_ is a post-processing tool for particle simulations, e.g. to calculate the porosity or coordination number.

QUEENS
~~~~~~

`QUEENS <https://github.com/queens-py/queens>`_ (Quantification of Uncertain Effects in Engineering Systems) is a Python framework for solver-independent multi-query analyses of large-scale computational models.
