FSI Tutorial 2d with *pre_exodus* and Cubit
==============================================

Introduction
------------

As example, we consider a 2d driven cavity example as sketched in Fig.
:ref:`1.1 <tut_fsi_preexo_2d:1.1>`.
For further details and references we refer the reader to [Wall99]_

   The driven cavity example in 2d

You can find the complete journal file within your |FOURC| distribution.
It is located in `<4C-sourcedir>/tests/framework-test/tutorial_fsi.jou`.

Within Cubit, open the Journal-Editor (*Tools*\ :math:`\to`\ *Journal
Editor*), paste the text from the journal file and press *play*.

Export now the created geometry and mesh to an exodus-file (filename: dc2d.exo) via
*File*\ :math:`\to`\ *Export...*. During export, set the dimension
explicitly to 2d.


General Procedure of Creating a Valid |FOURC| Input File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a given mesh including some nodal clouds to apply conditions to you
need another text-file (*bc-file*) where you specify, what you would
like to do with it. It contains for example the specific element
declaration (fluid, structure, parameters, etc.) and the particular
boundary condition such as Dirichlet or Neumann. Finally, a *header-file*
consists of general parameters such as solvers, algorithmic
parameters, etc. Those three files are merged by *pre_exodus* into an
input file for |FOURC|. This file is then *automatically* validated using
all available |FOURC| validation and is therefore likely to run.

Sure, you usually do not have already a proper *header-file* and
matching *bc-file*. By typing

.. container:: center

   ``./pre_exodus --exo=yourmesh.e``

you get two preliminary files ’default.head’ and ’default.bc’. The first
contains the currently valid header parameters with default values and
commented options which you can edit to adapt it to your means.
Similarly, ’default.bc’ consists of all your mesh entities and a list of
all currently valid conditions. See next section for details how to work
with it and how to get valid input files.

Running a Simulation with |FOURC|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the solver use the call

.. container:: center

   ``./4C [inputdirectory]/your_example.dat [outputdirectory]/outputprefix``

(in the |FOURC|-directory; of course, you may choose a different directory as well, if you take care for the path names).
The results are then written to the result directory with the prefix you chose.

The FSI problem with a partitioned solver
-------------------------------------------

Here, we create the |FOURC| input file for the FSI problem, that is solved
using a partitioned scheme, which means that the fluid and the solid problem are solved sequentially.
For a monolithic scheme, see :ref:`the section below<tut_fsi_preexo_2d:monolithic>`.

After running the |FOURC| executable without boundary condition and header information,
we have created the ’default.head’ and ’default.bc’ file` that we are now supposed to edit.

*header-file*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the following sections in ’default.head’ and edit as given:

-  ``ALE DYNAMIC``

   ``LINEAR_SOLVER        1``

-  ``FLUID DYNAMIC``

   ``CONVTOL              1e-08``

   ``GRIDVEL              BDF2``

   ``ITEMAX               50``

   ``LINEAR_SOLVER        2``

   ``TIMEINTEGR           Np_Gen_Alpha``

-  ``FSI DYNAMIC``

   ``MAXTIME              3``

   ``NUMSTEP              30``

   ``SECONDORDER          yes``

   ``SHAPEDERIVATIVES     yes``

   ``TIMESTEP             0.1``

-  ``SOLVER 1``

   ``NAME                 ALE solver``

   ``SOLVER               UMFPACK``

-  ``SOLVER 2``

   ``NAME                 Fluid solver``

   ``SOLVER               Aztec_MSR``

-  ``SOLVER 3``

   ``NAME                 Structure solver``

   ``SOLVER               UMFPACK``

-  ``STRUCTURAL DYNAMIC``

   ``LINEAR_SOLVER        3``

   ``TOLRES               1e-10``

-  ``MATERIALS``

   insert ``MAT 1 MAT_fluid DYNVISCOSITY 0.01 DENSITY 1.0`` for
   definition of fluid material

   insert ``MAT 2 MAT_ElastHyper NUMMAT 1 MATIDS 3 DENS 500`` to define
   a hyperelastic structural material

   insert ``MAT 3 ELAST_CoupNeoHooke YOUNG 250.0 NUE 0.0`` to specify
   the structural material as Neo-Hooke material

   insert
   ``MAT 4 MAT_Struct_StVenantKirchhoff YOUNG 1.0 NUE 0.0 DENS 1.0`` to
   define an ALE material

-  ``CLONING MATERIAL MAP``

   insert ``SRC_FIELD fluid SRC_MAT 1 TAR_FIELD ale TAR_MAT 4`` to
   specify the ALE material that is used for the fluid field

-  ``FUNCT 1``

   insert ``SYMBOLIC_FUNCTION_OF_SPACE_TIME (1-cos(2*t*pi/5))``
   defining time-dependent inflow and lid movement

-  ``FUNCT 2``

   insert ``SYMBOLIC_FUNCTION_OF_SPACE_TIME 10*(y-1)*(1-cos(2*t*pi/5))``
   representing the spatial inflow distribution

Safe the file under a different name, e.g. ’dc2d_fsi.head’.

*bc-file*
~~~~~~~~~~~

The main section of the `default.bc` file contains the element set and boundary condition information:

::

    --------------------------BCSPECS

    Element Block, named:
    of Shape: HEX8
    has <xxx> Elements
    *eb1="ELEMENT"
    sectionname=""
    description=""
    elementname=""

    [further element sections]

    Node Set, named: <bc_name>
    Property Name: none
    has <xx> Nodes
    *ns1="CONDITION"
    sectionname=""
    description=""

    [further node set definitions to be used for conditions]


Edit the ’default.bc’ file as follows:

For the element definitions, which are consecutively enumerated as ``eb<number>``:

-  ``*eb1="ELEMENT"`` the structure elements with their material

   .. container:: small

      ::

               sectionname="STRUCTURE"

Copy the following condition and parametrize it as given below to
further prescibe Dirichlet boundary conditions on the ALE field:

-  ``*ns6="CONDITION"``

   .. container:: small

      ::

               sectionname="DESIGN LINE ALE DIRICH CONDITIONS"
               description="NUMDOF 2 ONOFF 1 1 VAL 0.0 0.0 CURVE none none FUNCT 0 0"

As any of these conditions matches an already defined NodeSet it will
also match the corresponding ’E-id’ in the later |FOURC| input file.
Finally save the file under a different name, e.g. ’dc2d_fsi.bc’.

Creating |FOURC| Input File and Running the Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run in a shell

::

    ./pre_exodus --exo=dc2d.e --head=dc2d_fsi.head
   --bc=dc2d_fsi.bc --dat=dc2d_fsi.dat

where the filenames might have to be replaced accordingly.
This will result in the specified dat-file which is already validated to be accepted by |FOURC|.
However, if the file is meaningful cannot be assured.
Hint: When you have an already existing input file, you can always
validate it by simply executing ``./pre_exodus --dat=inputfile.dat``,
before(!) you start a parallel |FOURC| computation on a cluster, for
example.

Run the simulation by providing the created dat-file and an output file
to |FOURC| and postprocess the results.

.. _`tut_fsi_preexo_2d:postprocess`:

Postprocessing
--------------

You can postprocess your results with any visualization software you
like. In this tutorial, we choose *Paraview*.

Before you can open the results, you have to generate a filter again.
Call *make post_drt_ensight* in the |FOURC|-directory. Filter your results
in the output directory with the call

.. container:: center

   ``./post_drt_ensight --file=[outputdirectory]/outputprefix``

After this open *paraview*, go to

-  *File\ :math:`\to`\ Open Data* and select the filtered *\*.case
   file*.

-  Only for older versions of *Paraview*:

   -  Select the time step in the *Select Time Value* window on the left
      and

   -  shift *Byte order* to *little endian*

-  Click on *accept* (or *apply*) to activate the display.

-  In the *Display tab* (section *Color*) you can choose now between
   *Point pressure* and *Point velocity*, whatever you want to display.

-  Use a *warp vector* to visualize the simulation results on the
   deformed domain.

-  For the scale, activate the *Scalar bar* button in the *View
   section*.

.. _`tut_fsi_preexo_2d:monolithic`:

The FSI problem with a monolithic solver
----------------------------------------

There are two possibilities for monolithic schemes:

-  fluid-split: the fluid field is chosen as slave field, the structure
   field is chosen as master field.

-  structure-split: the structure field is chosen as slave field, the
   fluid field is chosen as master field.

In order to use a monolithic solver, change the coupling algorithm
``COUPALGO`` in the ``FSI DYNAMIC`` section in the \*.head-file.
Additionally, special care has to be taken of the interface degrees of
freedom, that are subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The
interface is always governed by the master field. The slave interface
degrees of freedom do not occur in the global system of equations and,
thus, are not allowed to carry Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Tolerances for the nonlinear convergence check in monolithic FSI are set
with the following parameters in the ``FSI DYNAMIC`` section:

.. container:: center

   | ``TOL_DIS_INC_INF``
   | ``TOL_DIS_INC_L2``
   | ``TOL_DIS_RES_INF``
   | ``TOL_DIS_RES_L2``
   | ``TOL_FSI_INC_INF``
   | ``TOL_FSI_INC_L2``
   | ``TOL_FSI_RES_INF``
   | ``TOL_FSI_RES_L2``
   | ``TOL_PRE_INC_INF``
   | ``TOL_PRE_INC_L2``
   | ``TOL_PRE_RES_INF``
   | ``TOL_RPE_RES_L2``
   | ``TOL_VEL_INC_INF``
   | ``TOL_VEL_INC_L2``
   | ``TOL_VEL_RES_INF``
   | ``TOL_VEL_RES_L2``

fluid split
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Choose ``iter_monolithicfluidsplit`` as ``COUPALGO`` in the
   ``FSI DYNAMIC`` section.

-  Modify Dirichlet condition ``*ns12="CONDITION"`` to

   .. container:: small

      ::

               sectionname="DESIGN POINT DIRICH CONDITIONS"
               description="NUMDOF 3 ONOFF 0 0 0 VAL 0.0 0.0 0.0 CURVE none none none FUNCT 0 0 0"

   in order to remove the Dirichlet boundary conditions from the fluid
   (=slave) interface degrees of freedom.

Create the input file as described above. Start |FOURC| as usual.

structure split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Choose ``iter_monolithicstructuresplit`` as ``COUPALGO`` in the
   ``FSI DYNAMIC`` section.

-  Modify Dirichlet condition ``*ns4="CONDITION"`` to

   .. container:: small

      ::

               sectionname="DESIGN POINT DIRICH CONDITIONS"
               description="NUMDOF 2 ONOFF 0 0 VAL 0.0 0.0 CURVE none none FUNCT 0 0"

   in order to remove the Dirichlet boundary conditions from the
   structure (=slave) interface degrees of freedom.

Create the input file as described above. Start |FOURC| as usual.
