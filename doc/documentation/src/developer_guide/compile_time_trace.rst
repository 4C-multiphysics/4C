Clang Time Tracing
==================

Overview
--------

Clang's *time tracing* feature records detailed timing information during the
compilation process. This helps identify slow compilation units and
bottlenecks in the build system.

In our project, a full time tracing run is executed **once per night** as part
of nightly testing. The latest nightly Clang time tracing report is published
automatically and can be viewed here:
