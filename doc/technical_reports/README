1) How to generate a tech report

-> Use ./configure to generate Makefile and master tex 
   documents in tex_aux_log_etc

-> Use make to generate reports in subdirectory reports
   
   make          :   global & single reports
   make global   :   create only one master document
   make single   :   create one pdf for each chapter
   make clean    :   remove all generated documents

2) How to add a tech report

-> add a new subdirectory to src/
   it must be named like

               src_doohickey

-> create file named 

               src_doohickey.tex

   in this new directory. This file is your main document.
   You are allowed to include files and pictures ---
   use unique names for labels (like fsi:couple, fsi:basic_equation, ...)
   to avoid name clashes in master document!

   If you are using subdirectories, the path should be 
   specified relative to the src_doohickey directory
   e.g. \includegraphics{figures/baum} to include baum.eps
   Do NOT use the \graphicspath command!
   It is already used by the configure script.

-> run ./configure and make
