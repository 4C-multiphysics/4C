1) How to generate a tech report

   -> Use ./configure to generate Makefile and master tex 
      documents in tex_aux_log_etc

   -> Use make to generate reports in subdirectory reports
   
      make           :   global & single reports
      make global    :   create only one master document
      make single    :   create one pdf for each chapter
      make clean     :   remove all generated documents
      make reconfig  :   remove all generated documents and re-configure

2) How to add a tech report

   -> add a new subdirectory to src/
      it can be named like

               titleofreport

   -> create file named in this new directory.

               titleofreport.tex

   -> in Makefile.in add report to appropriate part of Baci guide 

               src/titleofreport/titleofreport.tex


   The LaTex file "titleofreport.tex" is your main document.
   You are allowed to include files and pictures ---
   use unique names for labels (like titleofreport:couple, 
   titleofreport:basic_equation, ...) to avoid name clashes 
   in master document!
   
   If you are using subdirectories, the path should be 
   specified relative to the "titleofreport" directory
   e.g. \includegraphics{figures/convergence_diagram} to include baum.eps
   Do NOT use the \graphicspath command!
   It is already used by the configure script.

   -> run ./configure and make
