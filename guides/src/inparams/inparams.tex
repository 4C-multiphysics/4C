\chapter{Input parameters}

%%
%%============================
\section{Overview}

The total input of \ccarat{} is read from formated input files that contain
all data to define a problem. The file is divided in single blocks
by horizontal lines which end with a key word specifying the following
content. There must not be spaces in front of a keyword. An example
is the \kw{PROBLEM TYP} introductory line 
\begin{verbatim}
-------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM TYP
\end{verbatim}
Plenty of keyword lines and blocks refere to special applications
of the program (such as \kw{OPTIMIZATION}, \kw{ALE DYNAMIC} etc.). These often
can be omitted when not required, which shortens the file and eases
its use. Other blocks however are of general character and must not
be left out in order to obtain a valid input file.

The order of the blocks can be chosen arbitrary while a convention
certainly increases comfort. The single blocks are explained in more
detail subsequently. Emphasis is here put on those blocks which are
of general meaning and are used within all kinds of different problem
types. Specific problem dependent blocks such as \kw{ALE SOLVER}, \kw{FLUID
DYNAMIC} or \kw{OPTIMISATION} can be added to this manually as required.

\section{Comments}
Comments start with $\backslash\backslash$. These can appear in the first
rows or somewhere else. Everything on their right side is a comment and
neglected.

\subsection{Title}
\begin{verbatim}
-------------------------------------------------------------TITLE
\end{verbatim}

---TITLE 

This block contains the expressive and individual title of your input
problem. 

read in: inpctrhead() in input\_full/input\_ctr\_head.c 

used for: writing it to output file 

written by: hand 

remarks: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The title can be used to set special treatments for selected examples
(which may be advisable for testing only). 
\item The title may be empty or contain up to five lines. 
\item The TITLE head line must not be omitted.
\end{itemize}

% ---PROBLEM SIZE

% This block contains the overal size of your input problem. The elements,
% nodes and materials of all involved fields are added here. 

% read in: inpctrprob() in input\_full/input\_control\_global.c

% used for: filling the respective genprob values 

% written by: preprocessor (GiD) 

% contains: 

% \begin{lyxlist}{00.00.0000}

% file 
% \item [{NODES}] total number of FE-nodes which are listed in the input
% file 
% \item [{DIM}] number of spatial dimensions the problem uses, 2 or 3 
% \item [{MATERIALS}] number of materials defined subsequently 
% \item [{NUMDF}] maximal number of degrees of freedom to one FE node 
% \end{lyxlist}
% remarks: 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item There must be at least one material.

% \end{itemize}
% ---PROBLEM TYP 

% This block contains the general information about the type of problem
% to be solved and influences the control routine of the problem. 

% read in: inpctrprob() in input\_full/input\_control\_global.c

% used for: filling the respective genprob values 

% written by: preprocessor (GiD) but check it manually! 

% contains: 

% \begin{lyxlist}{00.00.0000}
% \item [{PROBLEMTYP}] can be Ale, Fluid, Fluid\_Structure\_Interaction,
% Optimisation, Structure, Structure\_Structure\_Interaction

% \item [{RESTART}] step number from which to restart; 0 for no restart 
% \item [{NUMFIELD}] problem can consist of up to three (physical) fields 
% \item [{GRADERW}] flag to use gradient enhanced material model (for wall
% elements only) 
% \item [{MULTISC\_STRUCT}] flag to use structural multiscale analysis (for
% wall elements and static calculations only?) 
% \item [{TRACE}] secure or fast flag to switch tracing of subroutine structures
% on or of (works for debug only) 
% \end{lyxlist}
% remarks: 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item If a step for restart is specified, restart has to be given as additional
% program argument also . 
% \item The TRACE option is the first thing to be read from the input file
% and this is done in inptrace() in input\_full/input\_ctr\_head.c . 
% \item The PROBLEM TYP block must not be omitted
% \end{itemize}
% ---DISCRETISATION 

% This block gives the number of discretisations per field. Only the
% first discretisation is read from the input file. All additional ones
% have to be created according to the special needs of the algorithm
% used. Nodes and elements of additional discretisations do not occur
% within the total node and element numbers within the PROBLEM SIZE
% block.

% \item [{NUMSTRUCDIS}] number of discretisations in structure field 
% \item [{NUMALEDIS}] number of discretisations in ale field (=1) 
% \end{lyxlist}
% remarks: 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Second discretisations are needed for example for the projection method
% or multiscale methods. 
% \item The discretisation block may be omitted. One discretisation per field
% is assumed in this case.
% \end{itemize}

% ---DESIGN DESCRIPTION

% This block contains the number of design entities. The design elements
