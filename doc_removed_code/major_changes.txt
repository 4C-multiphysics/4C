List of major features that were removed from BACI, including date and revision where code was removed


xfem combust module (by Flo Henke, Ursula Rasthofer, Benedikt Schott)
- removed in revision 23268 on 2017-07-27
- reasons: most of the functionality has been shifted to the current CutFEM framework (see drt_fluid_xfluid and drt_xfem)
- if you need it: Check revision 23268
- what has not been shifted to the new framework so far: load balancing, some combustion tests, periodic boundary conditions
- mainly deleted src/drt_combust and some outdated files in src/drt_xfem, files in Input/combust*.dat
- removed by B. Schott

interface to aero code (by Georg Hammerl)
- removed in revision 23256 on 2017-07-13
- reasons: it is unlikely that we use that particular coupling scenario in the coming years, thus reduce code complexity by not carrying it around
- if you want to couple to other codes: check the interfaces in 23254 in Input/fs3i_aero_tfsi_flat_plate.dat and the implementation in src/drt_fs3i/aero_tfsi*
- Removed by M. Kronbichler

meshfree analysis (by Keijo Nissen)
- removed in revision 23256 on 2017-07-13
- reasons: invasive implementation, got outdated with respect to the standard polynomial fluid implementation, no active member of LNM can maintain this functionality
- if you need it: Check revision 23254, get one of the test files or a file by Keijo Nissen
- removed by M. Kronbichler

curves
- removed in revision 23111 on 2017-05-05
- In the course of BACI clean up, Andrea La Spina, Moritz Thon, and Svenja Schoeder were assigned to clean the functions and time
  curves. Motivation was that functions allowed for time dependence but not the full flexibility as curves and that time derivatives
  were not always correctly evaluated due to several time dependencies or return of 0 as default. Therefore, functions were extended
  such that they can depend on self defined variables which in turn can have time dependencies. For details and the commit message,
  see details/2017_Function.txt
- Removed by: A. Laspina, S. Schoeder, M. Thon

contact module (by Philipp Farah, Alexander Popp, Tobias Wiesner)
- removed in revision 23062 on 2017-04-26
- The code infrastructure that selects parts of the code and applies patches to remove inter-module dependencies turned out to be too brittle and fail regularly
- If you want to include separate modules: Check the functionality to support modules that was applied in CMakeLists.txt and do-configure of -r23061, but try to find a version that does not rely on patches because the BACI source code changes to often.
- Removed by: M. Kronbichler

lung inverse analysis (by Sophie Rausch)
- removed in revision 22737 on 2016-12-27
- This type of analysis was not used for many years. The features of this inverse analysis are also in gen_inv_analysis.
- If you need it: Find one of Sophie's dat file and use it. Think if you could write a more general monitor-file, to use the gen_inv_analysis.
- Removed by: A. Birzle

crack propagation (by Sudhakar Yogaraj)
- removed in revision 22725 on 2016-12-22
- due to invasive implementation and difficulty to maintain and migrate to new structural time integration

potential (by Ursula Mayer)
- removed in revision 22495 on 2016-10-18
- reasons: invasive implementation, outdated functionality, knowledge about functionality was lost at the institute, no active member of LNM was to be made responsible for shifting this implementation to the new structural time integration.
- removed by A. Rauch
