List of major features that were removed from BACI, including date and revision where code was removed

lung inverse analysis (by Sophie Rausch)
- removed in revision 22737 on 2016-12-27
- This type of analysis was not used for many years. The features of this inverse analysis are also in gen_inv_analysis.
- If you need it: Find one of Sophie's dat file and use it. Think if you could write a more general monitor-file, to use the gen_inv_analysis.
- Removed by: A. Birzle

crack propagation (by Sudhakar Yogaraj)
- removed in revision 22725 on 2016-12-22
- due to invasive implementation and difficulty to maintain and migrate to new structural time integration
