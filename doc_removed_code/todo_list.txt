List of code projects that need to be done in the near future, e.g. student projects / BACI cleaning week

===============================
New structural time integration
(things that were available in the old structural time integration, but have not yet been moved)
for questions: Alexander Popp
===============================
- explicit time integration (explicit Euler, central differences, Adams-Bashforth, critical time step)
- explicit time integration (also for penalty-based contact)
- time adaptivity for structural dynamics (Zienkiewicz-Xie, auxiliary time integrators, e.g. explicit see above)
- time adaptivity for FSI (work of Matthias Mayr)
- physics-based preconditioners for shells (scaled thickness conditioning (STC) for solid-shells)
- energy-momentum conservation (GEMM, GEMM for contact, velocity update method for contact)
- MueLu-based solvers / preconditioners for mesh tying and contact (work of Tobias Wiesner)

===============================
New structural time integration
(things that we did not have in the old structural time integration, but would be very useful)
for questions: Alexander Popp
===============================
- axisymmetric 2D wall element (as an extension to the wall element)
- explicit dynamics (critical time step estimates for most common solid elements, contact, etc.)
