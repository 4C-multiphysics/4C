    /*! \brief Modified GenAlpha time integrator for Lie groups
     *
     *  We need this for all beam elements with rotation vector
     *  DoFs (currently beam3r, beam3k) because those are non-
     *  additive and the corresponding rotation tensors are
     *  members of the special orthogonal group SO3 which is no
     *  vector space!
     *
     *  The implementation is based on [Arnold, Bruels (2007)],
     *  [Bruels, Cardona, 2010] and [Bruels, Cardona, Arnold (2012)].
     *  See also Christoph Meier's dissertation for explanations,
     *  governing equations, differences to classical GenAlpha,
     *  comments on why we chose this time discretization, ...
     *
     *  In theory, this should be a generalization of classical
     *  GenAlpha, which yields the same results if applied to
     *  problems whose primary DoFs are elements of vector spaces.
     *
     *  The main difference to classical GenAlpha is that a
     *  modified acceleration vector is introduced (see accn_mod_)
     *  and that the weak form is evaluated at t_{n+1} only.
     *
     *  Furthermore, the update of non-additive rotation vector
     *  DoFs needs a special (multiplicative) treatment. However,
     *  for the implemented beam elements with rotation vector DoFs,
     *  the calculation of angular velocities and accelerations
     *  from temporal derivatives of the primary rotation vector DoFs
     *  is intricate (because of non-linear triad interpolation
     *  schemes). Therefore, these beam elements first discretize
     *  in time and apply the Newmark scheme to space-continuous
     *  angular velocities and accelerations. All this (including
     *  storage of old state variables) happens inside the beam
     *  elements. The beam elements are therefore independent from
     *  the velocity and acceleration vectors on time integrator level.
     *
     *  However, in mixed discretizations (beams and other elements),
     *  we need the global velocity and acceleration vector to evaluate
     *  the inertia terms of all other than beam elements in the usual manner.
     *  Note: because of the non-linear inertia forces and mass matrix,
     *        the beams require "MASSLIN = rotations" which evaluates
     *        inertia force and mass matrix in every iteration by calling
     *        Evaluate with action type "nlnstiffmass". Because this
     *        setting (ml_rotations) is true for entire discretization,
     *        all other than beam elements must adapt to this and also
     *        evaluate the inertia force and mass matrix inside the element.
     *
     *  Possible future work (to make this even nicer):
     *  We could use the global velocity and acceleration vectors
     *  for all translational (and hence additive) DoFs to compute
     *  the inertia terms inside the element but the rotation vector
     *  DoFs anyway need the element-internal treatment described above.
     *
     *  Note: - viscous Rayleigh damping is supported in principle, but
     *          never applied or tested yet!
     *
     *        - this is not yet rigorously tested with other than beam
     *          and rigidsphere elements and thus experimental code
