      * allcoupledrownodes_
      * allcoupledcolnodes_ (including ghosted master/slave nodes)

      This method contains a loop over all existing pairs of
      periodic boundary conditions (always two surfaces (3d) or lines
      (2d) belong to the same condition. They are usually referred to
      as corresponding "master" and "slave" conditons).

      For every pair a node coupling is generated by a call to the
      method CreateNodeCouplingForSinglePBC. This means, that we have
      the information which masternode id is coupled to which
      slavenode id (map midtosid).

      This node coupling is added to the connectivity map of all
      previous periodic boundary conditions (this allows pbcs in
      several spatial directions which are nescessary for example
      for 3d channel flows).

   o send slave nodes to master proc.

   o Generate a new dofset in which slaves do not have their own dofs
     anymore; they just point to the master's dofs

     After this function call, the nodes and elements are distributed
     among the processors according to the generated connectivity.
     During this procedure, the dof set is changed (coupled dofs are
     eliminated) and the dofs are renumbered.

  /*!
  \brief Couple nodes for specific pair of periodic boundary conditions.

  On input, this method needs two lists of nodes (master- and
  slavenodes). For every masternode, the method will look for the
  "closest" slavenode and insert this connectivity in the midtosid map.
  In this context, "closest" means, that one coordinate of the slavenode
  is replaced by the coordinate of the masternode plane for the search
  of the closest point. This is controlled by the parameter dofsforpbcplane,
  an int vector of length 3:


                     (1,1,0)    xy-plane

                     (0,1,1)    yz-plane

                     (1,0,1)    xz-plane

  The search algorithm will substitute the coordinate with 0 of the
  slavenodes by the corresponding coordinate of the masternode plane
  to calculate the closest node.

  Keep in mind that the masternodes and the slavenodes are distributed
  among several processors. The connectivity information will be only
  available on the proc which owns the specific masternode --- but the
  corresponding closest slavenode will be searched on all procs!

  The node matching is created in two steps. Step one generates a
  processor local octree that contains all masternodes available on
  this proc (NodeMatchingOctree nodematchingoctree).
  The second part searches for the closest slave node on
  all processors (nodematchingoctree.CreateGlobalNodeMatching).

  \brief Add the connectivity from this condition (midtosid, on input)
  to the connectivity of all previously processed periodic boundary
  conditions (allcoupledrownodes_).

  We are interested in a map of all coupled nodes. For nodes, which have
  several periodic boundary conditions (for example edge nodes for
  3d channel flow, see figure below), only one node (the pure master node)
  is allowed to have its own degrees of freedom. The mixed master/slave
  nodes must be eliminated and all connectivity information must be
  transferred to the pure master.

  of this coupling requires some additional communication of the coupling
  behaviour of multiple coupled nodes.
