## Description

Temporary folder for the taskforce modularization, in which core functionality (in contrast to "physics" based functionality) is collected after it has no remaining dependencies outside of the core cmake target. 

ONLY INTENDED FOR THE TASKFORCE MODULARIZATION FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES AND WILL BE (RE-)MOVED AFTER NEW CODE STRUCTURE IS DECIDED ON!

DO NOT ADD THINGS TO THIS DIRECTORY!
