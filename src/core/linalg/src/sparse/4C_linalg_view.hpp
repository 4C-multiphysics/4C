  /**
   * Temporary helper class for migration from raw Trilinos classes to our own wrappers. Views one
   * of the Trilinos linear algebra types as one of ours. It is the users responsibility to ensure
   * that the viewed source object outlives the view. Example:
   *
   * @code
   *   // Function taking our Vector type.
   *   void f(const Core::LinAlg::Vector<double>& vec);
   *
   *   // We only have an Epetra_Vector object.
   *   const Epetra_Vector& source = ...;
   *   // Create a view of the source object.
   *   Core::LinAlg::View view(source);
   *   // It behaves like our type Core::LinAlg::Vector<double> and converts implicitly.
   *   f(view); // works
   *   // Convert to our type explicitly
   *   const Core::LinAlg::Vector<double>& vec = view.underlying();
   * @endcode
   *
   * Another use case of this class is the following case. Suppose we want to wrap a class ExtA
   * which can return a reference to ExtB. We have our own wrappers for ExtA and ExtB, let us call
   * them MyA and MyB, respectively. Now we want to implement a function that returns a reference to
   * MyB from MyA, where the MyB is a view of the ExtB object returned by ExtA wrapped by MyA. The
   * code would look as follows:
   *
   * @code
   * //! The external class we want to wrap.
   * class ExtA
   * {
   *  public:
   *   const ExtB& get_b() { return b_; }
   *   void set_b(const ExtB& b) { b_ = b; }
   *  private:
   *   ExtB b_;
   * };
   *
   *  //! Our wrapper class for ExtA.
   * class MyA
   * {
   *  public:
   *   const MyB& get_b() { return b_view_.sync(ext_a_.get_b()); }
   *
   *  private:
   *   View<const MyB> b_view_;
   *   ExtA ext_a_;
   * };
   * @endcode
   *
   * Essentially, this ensures that whenever we call get_b() on MyA, we get a view of the _current_
   * ExtB object from ExtA. In the example above, one could call ExtA::set_b() and a subsequent
   * call to MyA::get_b() would return a view of the new ExtB object.
