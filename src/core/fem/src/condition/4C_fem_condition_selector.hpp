   * Oftentimes the DOFs of a field need to be split into a set of disjoint maps. The
   * Core::LinAlg::MultiMapExtractor class takes care of these splits. This function helps you to
   * set up the @p extractor by providing the necessary information. It takes a number of @p
   * selectors that encapsulate the conditions to be selected from the given Discretization @p dis.
   * Refer to the Selector class for more information on how conditions can be selected.
   *
   * The ordering of the maps in the extractor is as follows:
   *
   * - The first map is the "other" map, which contains all DOFs that are not selected by any of the
   *   conditions.
   * - The subsequent maps are the selected maps, which contain the DOFs of the selected conditions.
   *   The order of the maps is determined by the order of the selectors in the @p selectors
   *   vector.
   *
   * The optional @p is_overlapping flag indicates whether the selected conditions may have
   * overlapping dofs. By default, this is false.
   *
   * @note Each node ends up in one condition only, independent of whether all its dofs are selected
   * or not.
