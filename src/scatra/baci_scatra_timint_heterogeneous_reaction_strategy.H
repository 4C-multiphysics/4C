  /*!
  \brief Solution strategy for heterogeneous reactions

  To keep the scalar transport time integrator class and derived classes as plain as possible,
  several algorithmic parts have been encapsulated within separate meshtying strategy classes.
  These algorithmic parts include initializing the system matrix and other relevant objects,
  computing meshtying residual terms and their linearizations, and solving the resulting
  linear system of equations. By introducing a hierarchy of strategies for these algorithmic
  parts, a bunch of unhandy if-else selections within the time integrator classes themselves
  can be circumvented. This class contains the solution strategy for heterogeneous reactions.

    \brief Evaluate a given condition

     Evaluate terms of your weak formulation on elements marked with a given condition.

    \note The implementation of EvaluateCondition in this class, calls
          \ref DRT::Discretization::EvaluateCondition on the auxiliary
          discretization. Since, this discretization has the dofs of both,
          the volume-bound scalars and the surface bound scalars, every
          term involving one or both kinds of scalars can easily be evaluated.

          This discretization has all scatra (surface+volume) in one dofset.
          This is required by the advanced reaction framework. This is also
          the reason for the fact, that in your input file first the
          surface species have to be listed and then the volume species, since
          here we fix the order of dofs to be first surface, and then volume
          dofs.
